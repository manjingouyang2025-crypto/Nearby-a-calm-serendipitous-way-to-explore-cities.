Nearby is an AI-powered "Discovery Agent" designed to shift the user's perspective from transactional search to observational discovery. Unlike typical travel apps that prioritize "top-rated" or "popular" spots, Nearby focuses on the quiet, the overlooked, and the sensory.
What is it?
Nearby acts as a calm, local observer. You provide a location and a simple curiosity—like "the smell of roasting coffee" or "a place where the light is soft"—and the engine co-creates a "Journey" for you. It combines real-world data (verified via Google Search) with a poetic narrative structure, guiding you through an unfolding sequence of moments rather than just a list of pins on a map.
Why is it unique?
1. The "Anti-Search" Philosophy
Nearby doesn't look for the "best" Italian restaurant; it looks for the "steam rising from a narrow noodle shop at dusk." By prioritizing sensory details over ratings, it encourages a slower, more mindful interaction with the urban environment.
2. Narrative-Driven Exploration
Most discovery tools are fragmented. Nearby generates a cohesive experience using Narrative Bridges—AI-generated transitions that link physical locations into a poetic arc. It provides an introduction to set the mood and a conclusion to preserve the memory.
3. Generative Documentary Aesthetics
The app leverages Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate "Sensory Visuals" in a specific 35mm film, documentary style. This transforms the results from dry metadata into evocative, high-fidelity imagery that feels like a shared memory rather than a stock photo.
4. Contextual Serendipity (The Drift)
The "Just Drift" feature allows for zero-input discovery. It uses your current GPS or a chosen city to find a single, interesting point of interest that is currently operational, perfect for when you want to be surprised without the burden of planning.
5. The Archive as a Digital Scrapbook
Every journey is preserved in a local "Archive." This turns the act of exploring into a collection of "Past Moments," which can be revisited, shared via native mobile sharing, or sent directly to WhatsApp as a serialized digital journal.
6. Technical Precision
Under the hood, it utilizes Gemini 3 Pro with Thinking Budget to handle complex spatial reasoning and narrative construction, ensuring that the suggested paths make sense geographically while maintaining their artistic soul. It also uses Google Search grounding to guarantee that every "quiet pocket" it finds is actually open and real.
